    <h1>DOM Practice 2</h1>
    <p>
      You are to make a guess the number game in the div provided below. The
      following should happen. Your code should generate a random number between
      1 and 20. The text "Try the Game!" should change to notify the player if
      the number is too high or too low, or if you are correct! If you get the
      number correct the background should turn green on the div and the high
      score should change to reflect the new score. The ? should become the
      correct number! The score should start at 20 and go down by 1 each time
      the guess is incorrect. If the score hits 0, the player should lose the
      game. The player should be able to hit the again button to reset the game
      but the high score value should remain!
